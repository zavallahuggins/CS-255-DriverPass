# CS-255-DriverPass

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client of this project was a company called DriverPass. They were wanting to design a system that would aide students taking their driving test by teaching them DMV regulations through in person and online course work. 

What did you do particularly well?

I believe the UML diagrams I had created were detailed in the two use cases I was depicting. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one thing in this project, I would add more features that can be used by the driving instructor. I had focused mainly on the tasks that the student would be able to do, which is important, but the student is not the only user in this system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpretting the user's needs through the interview transcript provided in the beginning. This is where DriverPass was consulted to get an idea of what they are looking for in a final product. It is important to consider the user's needs since they will most likely be the ones that use it on a day-to-day basis. The users will have handson experience with the app and can easily identify what features are missing and what needs to be modified. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I try to design software with an Agile approach. I feel that the user's goals may change due to numerous different factors. Having the ability to shift the focus of the project is critical when large changes need to be implemented. I also try to gather as much information at the start to have the most accurate representation of what the user is expecting.
